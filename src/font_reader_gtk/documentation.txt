Documentation for the Font_Reader_2:

This C++ software reads a font file and stores all character information, including the bitmap, in a JSON file. The JSON file contains information about each character in the font, such as its width, height, left and top bearing, and the bitmap data. The software uses the FreeType library to load the font file and extract the character information.

The software takes four command-line arguments:

1>  The path to the font file to be processed.

2>  The path to the output JSON file.

3>  A boolean flag indicating whether to enable pixel-perfect rendering. This flag is converted from a string to a boolean using a map of true/false values.

4>  An integer value indicating the quality of the font rendering. The higher the value, the higher the quality of the font rendering.

The main function parses the command-line arguments and calls the storeCharsInfoInJSON function to process the font file and write the character information to the output JSON file. It also prints the output JSON string to the console.

To use this software, you can compile it using a C++ compiler and run it from the command line with the appropriate arguments. The software requires the FreeType library and the nlohmann JSON library to be installed.
